Database normalization is the process of organizing the attributes and tables of a relational database to minimize data redundancy.

Normalization involves decomposing a table into less redundant (and smaller) tables but without losing information; defining foreign keys in the old table referencing the primary keys of the new ones. The objective is to isolate data so that additions, deletions, and modifications of an attribute can be made in just one table and then propagated through the rest of the database using the defined foreign keys.

The relational model separates the logical design from the physical design: DBMS performance is a matter of physical designer using indexes, view materialization, big buffers, etc. It is not a matter of changing the logical design.

A typical example of normalization benefits is that an entity's unique ID is stored everywhere in the system but its name is held in only one table. The name can be updated more easily in one row of one table. A typical update in such an example would be the RIM company changing its name to BlackBerry.[5] That update would be done in one place and immediately the correct "BlackBerry" name would be displayed throughout the system.
