C #
Object-oriented programming language developed by Microsoft, as part of the software platform. NET. More ambition in creating the C # language was to create a simple, modern, object-oriented language general. Basis for C # is C + +, Java and somewhat languages ??such as Delphi, VB.NET and C.Toy is designed to balance power (C + +) with the possibility of rapid development (Visual Basic and Java). They represent a set of definitions of classes that contain in se and methods is located programming logic - the instructions that the computer izpalnyava.Programite of C # are one or more files with the extension. cs., which contain definitions of classes and other types. These files are compiled by the compiler of C # (csc) to executable code and as a result receive assemblies - files with the same name but with a different extension (. Exe or. Dll).

Microsoft. NET Framework
Platform created by Microsoft, which provides a programming model, a set of classes (FCL, Framework Class Library) and execution environment written especially for her code (CLR, Common Language Runtime). It is a key element of the development strategy of Microsoft, aimed most new Windows applications to be based on. NET Framework.
. NET applications written in high level languages ??(C #, VB.NET, C + + / CLI, etc.) and are compiled to platform-independent intermediate language called CIL (Common Intermediate Language). While performing CIL code (so-called "managed code") is automatically compiled by the CLR for a particular hardware platform and operating system with which the user is working.
